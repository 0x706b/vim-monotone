Another monochrome vim colorscheme. Inspired by various
[other](https://github.com/ewilazarus/preto)
[monochrome](https://github.com/pbrisbin/vim-colors-off)
[colorschemes](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome).

Monotone is a middle ground between a regular colorscheme and [no syntax
highlighting at all](https://www.kyleisom.net/blog/2012/10/17/syntax-off/). The
colorscheme differentiates comments, strings and keywords with different
weights and shades of gray. It emphasizes errors, warnings and search
highlighting as shown in the screenshots below.
